# Markdown

- To add a h1 header use " # "
- For h2 header use " # # "
- To add an image use the syntax "! "["  example  "]" (URL)" - The text inside square brackets (w/o quotes) is used to describe the image. It also works for screen readers.

  Here is an image example:

   ![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)



- To add a code block use " ``` "

  Here's an example:
